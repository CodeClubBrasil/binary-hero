## Introduction

Make a game in which you play the notes of a song as they scroll down the stage.

### What you will make

Click the green flag to play. Use `z`, `x`, `c` and `v` to play the correct notes when they reach the bottom of the stage. You'll score ten points for every correct note you play.
