## Challenge: incorrect notes

Your Binary Hero game is done now, but there are a few things you could do to make it even better!

For example, can you add code to change how the stage looks if the correct note isn't played?

You'll need to add code very similar to the code for when a correct note is played, and a costume has been provided for you.
